First, I created a new directory called homework and verified its creation.

Next, I created three subdirectories named dir1, dir2, and dir3.

Then, using the touch command, I created three files: File1.txt, File2.txt, and File3.txt.

Using the echo command combined with the redirection operator, I added some text to each file.

I searched for the word "first" within the content of the files in the current directory and found it in each of the three files.

Later, I used the find command to search for files whose names start with the expression "file"

Finally, I searched within dir1 for any file that had been modified within the last 7 days.
